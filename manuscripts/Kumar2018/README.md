## Abstract

The carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) are involved in the formation and modification of glycoproteins, glycolipids, starch, secondary metabolites, and cell wall biopolymers. They are the key enzymes for biosynthesis of food and renewable biomass. Woody biomass is particularly important for long-term carbon storage and as an abundant renewable natural resource for many industrial applications. This study presents de-novo annotation of CAZymes genes in the current Populus trichocarpa genome assembly, and their in silico functional characterization based on high resolution RNA-Seq datasets. Altogether 1918 CAZyme and expansin genes were annotated in 103 families of which 1798 were found expressed in at least one poplar organ. New CAZyme-families and new genes were identified, including genes involved in biosynthesis of different cell wall polymers.  Whereas similar families exist in poplar and Arabidopsis, different gene abundancies in some families and different transcriptome investment in differentiation of various tissues reflect the perennial lifestyle of poplar. To identify the transcriptional coordination and functional relatedness within the CAZymes and other proteins, we performed co-expression network analysis of CAZymes in wood forming tissues using the AspWood database (http://aspwood.popgenie.org/aspwood-v 3.0/). This provided an overview of the transcriptional changes in CAZymes during the transition from primary to secondary wall formation, and clustering of transcripts into potential regulons.  New candidate enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of polysaccharides were identified along with many tissue-specific uncharacterized genes and transcription factors. These collections offer a rich source of new targets for modification of secondary cell wall biosynthesis, and other developmental processes in woody plants.
