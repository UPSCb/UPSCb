# Content

This directory contains the html output of our analysis. The analysis have been conducted in `R` 
on our RStudio Server, the consequence of which is that their transcripts reflect our server
environment (directories, file paths, _etc._). However, all the necessary files to reproduce the
analyses should be available in the GitHub repository. The analysis transcripts are in the present
directory, the necessary document in the ../doc directory and in the helper R scripts in ../../../src/R.
